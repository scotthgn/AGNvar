# AGNvar

Python code for spectral timing analysis of AGN - currently under 'construction'.
Will eventually have following functionality:

1. Create composite AGN strucutre models (i.e Accretion disc + BLR clouds)
2. Calculate impulse response functions for any combination of AGN structure models
3. Evolve a spectral band given an input X-ray light-curve
4. Also create and evolve entire spectra (mostly for fun - computationally intense, but can give informative animations for talks etc)
